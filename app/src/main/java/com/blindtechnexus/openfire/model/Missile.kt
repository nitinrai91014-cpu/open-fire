/**
 * Pure missile rules, shared by the shop, the battle engine and Robert.
 *
 * A missile is a guided, guaranteed kill:
 *  - it unlocks after round two has been completed and costs
 *    [MISSILE_PRICE] coins, appearing in the normal weapon inventory;
 *  - every launch consumes exactly one missile power ([MISSILE_POWER_PRICE]
 *    coins each). Powers stack like defences and must be bought again once
 *    used;
 *  - once launched it tracks its target with 100% accuracy and reduces the
 *    target directly to zero health, no matter whether the target runs,
 *    hides behind a glue wall or hides behind a cover. Even the player's
 *    second chance cannot save against a direct missile hit;
 *  - the target still tries to run as far away as possible inside the 100 m
 *    arena while the missile sound plays. If the target can run, the sound
 *    loops and is cut the moment the missile impacts; if the target has
 *    nowhere left to run, the sound plays once and the missile impacts as
 *    it ends. The explosion (and the hit sound of the destroyed fighter)
 *    always plays at impact, mixed together, and the battle only ends once
 *    the explosion sound has really finished ([EXPLOSION_MS]);
 *  - in round three Robert has no anti-missile system at all, so a launched
 *    missile simply makes him sprint away at his fast speed, running and
 *    dodging inside the zone until the missile catches him;
 *  - from round four Robert owns an anti-missile system, but he may only
 *    fire it in an end-game situation: his health below
 *    [ANTI_MISSILE_MAX_HP] while a player missile is in the air. Round
 *    four holds two interceptors, round five holds four;
 *  - from round four Robert also carries one missile power per game (two in
 *    round five). He spends it only as a desperation weapon while he is
 *    clearly losing.
